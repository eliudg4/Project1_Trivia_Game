While creating this Jeopardy game HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were mainly used.

User Stories:
    As a user, I want to make sure that the game is user-friendly
    As a user, I want to make sure that the instructions are given before the start of the game
    The game should differentiate between correct and incorrect answers
    The game should tally the player's score correctly.
    As a user, buttons should work when clicked
    As a user, player should be notified if they have won


The biggest unsolved problem would have to be my CSS, nothing seemed to work as it was supposed to. As for major hurdles, I would say was making the score board function and give the correct score after answering a question correct.
